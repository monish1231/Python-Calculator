# Basic calculator using python

Hello, am Monish BCA graduate, currently in MCA specializing in Generative AI.
This is my first python based mini project - a basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations using terminal input

# Features :
- add,subtract,divide,multiply
- clean output with exception handling, positive,negative & decimal numbers, dividing by 0 and all

I practiced using python functions, loops & user input; handled 'value error' and 'keyboard interrupt'
